            <h1>Gen Z (1997 - 2012)</h1>
        <h2>Who is Gen Z?</h2>
    <p class="special-p">Gen Z is characterized as being more ethnically and racially diverse, more socially and politically concious, and more open to change than previous generations.
        They have the highest expectations for newform technology such as AI and Virtual Reality and also have gone their whole lives without knowing a life without the internet.
    </p>
    <h3>Gen Z And Never Knowing A World Without The Internet</h3>
    <p class="special-p">Gen Z is considered the first generation to grow up with widespread access to the internet and social media. Generation Z is the first generation that is unlikely to ever use 
        a road atlas, encyclopedia, a fax machine or rely whatsoever on a printed newspaper. Genealogy research for this generation wonâ€™t mingle much with microfilm or old paper 
        records but instead will collect most information from online sources and family collections.
    </p>
    <h3>How does Gen Z use technology and digital media?</h3>
    <p class="special-p">Gen Z is fluent in navigating the online world and uses their gadgets for many everyday activities, including chatting, video chats, studying, games, and channeling creativity. 
        A study says 66% of Gen Z use more than one gadget at once. Gen Z's seamless use of technology and preference for shorter content has implications for content creators, 
        marketers, and app developers. The demand for brief, engaging content and user-friendly, visually-driven app interfaces will continue growing due to this. Gen Z has the 
        highest expectations for emerging, Internet-connected technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality (VR). 82% of Gen Z believes biometrics will see 
        increased adoption in the next five years, while 77% believe the same about VR. 
    </p>
    <h3>How has digital media negatively impacted Gen Z?</h3>
    <p class="special-p">Spending more time on electronic devices and less time reading books can have implications for Gen Z's attention spans, vocabulary, academic performance, and future 
        economic contributions. This obsession with technology can result in psychological, physical and social disorders, such as:</p>
        <ul class="list-style">
            <li>Depression</li>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>Repetitive motion disorder</li>
            <li>Sleep deprivation</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="special-p">
        Gen Z's vocabulary has also been impacted due to less books being read and the widespread use of slang being implimented into the daily lives of this generation, largely
        due to the online culture that comes with the internet and digital media. Academic performance has been largely impacted due to this, as well as the shorter attention spans.
        The culmination of all of these things will eventually lead to lesser economic contributions later in Gen Z's life, especially as we see more of this generation graduate from
        college and enter the workforce.
